CPU-Temperature
===============


In this tutorial we will develop a simple temperature monitoring system with SignalF for the Raspberry Pi. Depending on the processor temperature, the system will control various LEDs and a fan to cool the processor.

You will learn how to integrate devices and data output components into SignalF. We will also create a simple logic to monitor the temperature. In the last step, we will connect the individual components using configuration.
